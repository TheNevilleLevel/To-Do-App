Guide on how to use the To-Do-App

First start by clickingin the block where it states "What task do you want to list?". Proceed to then type out the task you wish you add to the list for you to do and click on "add task"

After you have completed that you will notice under "tasks" you written task will be listed in white. As it is now you can't do anything to the listing. However if you click on the "edit" button the task will change to a pink colour and now you can edit the listing for if it's changed or if you made a spelling mistake, then click on "save". If you have completed the task you have listed simply click on the "delete" button and the listed task will disappear. That is how to use my To-Do-App.
